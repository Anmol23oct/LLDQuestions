# ðŸ§® C# vs Python Implementation â€” Level 2 Evaluation

Yes â€” both the C# and Python implementations for **Level 2** are designed carefully to follow best practices, with **SOLID principles** and **design patterns** in mind.

This breakdown shows how both versions maintain good **object-oriented design** and are structured for **maintainability** and **extensibility**.

## âœ… C# â€“ SOLID & Design Pattern Evaluation

| Principle | How It's Followed |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **SRP** | `Account` handles balance logic; `BankingSystem` manages accounts, transactions, and ranking logic. |
| **OCP** | New transaction types (like cashback or scheduled payments) can be added by inheriting from `Transaction` without modifying existing code. |
| **LSP** | All transaction subclasses (`DepositTransaction`, `TransferTransaction`) inherit from `Transaction` and respect its interface. |
| **ISP** | Interface segregation isn't critical at Level 2, but interfaces (e.g., `ITransaction`) can be introduced at Level 3/4. |
| **DIP** | `BankingSystem` depends on `Transaction` abstraction, not specific types â€” extensibility is high. |

### ðŸ”§ Design Pattern Usage
- **Strategy Pattern Ready**: Each transaction is encapsulated in a class, and logic is executed via `Execute()`.
- **Factory Method Ready**: You can build a `TransactionFactory` to instantiate the correct type.
- **Clean State Management**: `outgoingTotals` is maintained outside `Account`, keeping it clean and focused.

## âœ… Python â€“ SOLID & Design Pattern Evaluation

| Principle | How It's Followed |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **SRP** | `Account` class just tracks balance; `BankingSystem` orchestrates system logic; `Transaction` classes encapsulate transaction behavior. |
| **OCP** | New transactions can be added (e.g., `CashbackTransaction`, `ScheduledPaymentTransaction`) by extending `Transaction` class. |
| **LSP** | All `Transaction` subclasses override `execute()` and can be used interchangeably. |
| **ISP** | Not explicitly needed yet, but lightweight interfaces can be introduced later. |
| **DIP** | `BankingSystem` relies on `Transaction` abstraction only â€” logic can be swapped easily. |

### ðŸ”§ Design Pattern Usage
- **Strategy Pattern**: Each transaction's logic is encapsulated and polymorphic.
- **Factory Pattern Ready**: A factory method can return the correct `Transaction` subclass.
- **Separation of Data and Logic**: Outgoing totals tracked externally from `Account`.
