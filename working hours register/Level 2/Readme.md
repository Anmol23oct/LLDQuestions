# üßë‚Äçüíª Level 2 ‚Äì Contract Worker Time Tracking System

## ‚úÖ Objective

Extend the existing worker time tracking system to support ordered statistics retrieval based on working hours and job position.

---

## üÜï New Operation

### `TOP_N_WORKERS <n> <position>`

Returns the top **n** workers (by total time spent in the office) with a given **position**.

#### üìå Format:
```plaintext
"workerId1(timeSpentInOffice1), workerId2(timeSpentInOffice2), ..., workerIdN(timeSpentInOfficeN)"
üìö Rules:
Count only finished work sessions (i.e., complete entry and exit pairs).

If a worker has no finished session, their time is 0.

Workers are sorted:

By time spent in descending order.

Alphabetically by workerId in case of tie.

If fewer than n workers exist for the position, return all matching workers.

If no workers exist with the given position, return an empty string.

üßæ Input Format
An array of queries. Each query can be one of the following:

python
Copy
Edit
["ADD_WORKER", workerId, position, salary]
["REGISTER", workerId, timestamp]
["TOP_N_WORKERS", n, position]
üì§ Output
An array of strings, each corresponding to the result of the executed query.
