# üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Level 3 ‚Äì Worker Promotion and Salary Calculation System

## üìù Overview
In this level, we extend the worker attendance system with:

- **PROMOTE**: Support for tracking promotions and salary changes based on office re-entry.
- **CALC_SALARY**: Calculation of salary within a time window, factoring in different compensations for different roles.
- Enhancements to `TOP_N_WORKERS` and `GET` to account for role-based filtering and time aggregation.

---

## üßæ Supported Commands

### ‚ûï `ADD_WORKER <workerId> <position> <compensation>`
Adds a new worker with an initial position and hourly compensation.  
**Returns:** `"registered"`

---

### ‚è± `REGISTER <workerId> <timestamp>`
Toggles worker‚Äôs entry/exit at the specified timestamp.  
- If entering: starts a new office session.  
- If exiting: ends the session.  
**Returns:** `"registered"`

---

### üöÄ `PROMOTE <workerId> <newPosition> <newCompensation> <startTimestamp>`
Schedules a promotion (with position and compensation) to take effect **only when the worker re-enters the office** after or at `startTimestamp`.

**Returns:**
- `"success"` if promotion is registered and not yet applied.
- `"invalid_request"` if the worker was already promoted or does not exist.

---

### üí∞ `CALC_SALARY <workerId> <startTimestamp> <endTimestamp>`
Calculates salary over the given period considering:
- Only **completed** sessions.
- Compensation **during that session** (which may change due to promotions).

**Returns:** total salary as string (e.g. `"35000"`), or `""` if worker not found.

---

### üìà `TOP_N_WORKERS <n> <position>`
Returns top `n` workers with the **current** position sorted by:
1. Total time spent (descending),
2. Alphabetically by worker ID (tie-breaker).  
**Returns:** e.g. `"John(75), Alice(60)"` or `""`.

---

### üìä `GET <workerId>`
Returns total time spent **across all positions**, even old ones.  
**Returns:** total time as string (e.g. `"250"`)

---

  "45500",             # Salary = 15*200 + 150*200 + 25*500 = 45500
  "0"                  # No session in the time range
]
üìå Notes
PROMOTE doesn't take effect immediately, only after a re-entry past startTimestamp.

Salary is computed only for completed sessions.

GET aggregates across all roles, while TOP_N_WORKERS only considers the current role.
