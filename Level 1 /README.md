# üß© Applying SOLID Principles

### ‚úÖ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- `Account`: Manages account-specific operations.
- `Transaction`: Encapsulates logic for executing a transaction.
- `BankingSystem`: Coordinates accounts and transactions.

### ‚úÖ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- You can introduce new types of `Transaction` without altering existing class logic.

### ‚úÖ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Derived `Transaction` classes can be used anywhere `Transaction` is expected.

### ‚úÖ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Interface segregation is respected if we extract interfaces for specific operations.

### ‚úÖ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- `BankingSystem` depends on `Transaction` abstraction, not on concrete implementations.

# üõ†Ô∏è Design Patterns Utilized

### üè≠ Factory Pattern
- Used to generate different `Transaction` objects (e.g., `DepositTransaction`, `TransferTransaction`).

### üß† Strategy Pattern
- Encapsulates different transaction execution logic and allows them to be interchanged dynamically.

# üß± Class Structure

1. **Account**: Manages balance and handles deposit/withdraw operations.
2. **Transaction** *(abstract base class)*: Represents all types of operations (e.g., deposit, withdrawal, transfer).
3. **BankingSystem**: Orchestrates account creation, transaction execution, and system-level queries.

üß© Applying SOLID Principles
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

Each class has a single responsibility:

Account handles account-related operations.

Transaction handles transaction execution.

BankingSystem manages accounts and transactions.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

The system is open for extension but closed for modification.

New transaction types can be added by extending the Transaction class without modifying existing code.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

Subclasses of Transaction can be used interchangeably with the base class without altering the correctness of the program.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

Interfaces (if introduced) should be specific to client needs to avoid forcing classes to implement unnecessary methods.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

High-level modules (BankingSystem) depend on abstractions (Transaction), not on concrete implementations.

üõ†Ô∏è Design Patterns Utilized
Factory Pattern:

To create different types of transactions (DepositTransaction, TransferTransaction) based on input parameters.

Strategy Pattern:

To encapsulate algorithms for different transaction types, allowing them to be interchangeable.
